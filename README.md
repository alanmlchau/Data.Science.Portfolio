## Data Preprocessing 
  Here in this project, our main goal is to preprocess the data (elimilating Nan, selecting needed data, etc.) of [here](https://github.com/alanmlchau/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Energy%20Indicators.xls) Energy Indicators.xls (a list of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the United Nations for the year 2013), world_bank.csv (countries' GDP from 1960 to 2015 from World Bank) and scimagojr-3.xlsx (which use data from 1996-2018 to rank countries based on their journal contributions in the aforementioned area) and then combine all three data set to answer various questions regarding renewable energy usage and development among the countries.
